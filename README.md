# ðŸ¤– Line Follower Robot Using Raspberry Pi Pico 

I'm delighted to share an exciting project that showcases the fusion of hardware and programming expertise - a Line Follower Robot built using Raspberry Pi Pico, IR sensors, and the power of Python programming language.

Project Overview:
In this hands-on endeavour, our team successfully developed a sophisticated line follower robot capable of autonomously navigating a predefined path using infrared (IR) sensors for precise line tracking.
By harnessing the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and Python programming language, we created an intelligent and versatile robot that paves the way for exciting applications.

Key Features:

Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontroller: The Raspberry Pi Pico acted as the brain of our robot, providing ample processing power and GPIO capabilities to handle the sensor inputs and control the robot's movements.

IR Sensors for Line Tracking: We integrated infrared (IR) sensors into the robot's design to detect and follow the line path accurately. The IR sensors provided real-time feedback to the Raspberry Pi Pico, enabling precise adjustments in the robot's trajectory.

Python Programming Language: Leveraging the simplicity and versatility of Python, we programmed the robot's behaviour and decision-making algorithms. Python's ease of use allowed us to focus on creating sophisticated control logic efficiently.

Autonomous Navigation: Our line follower robot featured autonomous navigation capabilities, ensuring it could smoothly traverse the designated path without human intervention. The combination of IR sensors and Python-based control logic enabled seamless line tracking.

Modular Design and Expandability: The robot's modular design allowed for easy upgrades and expansions. This adaptability opens up opportunities to add additional sensors or features, making it an ideal platform for future enhancements
